# Kickoff Decisions

The decisions needed to start building, compiled from the **Decisions to confirm**
sections of the five design docs. Each has a **recommendation** (bold) and an ID
so choices can be recorded tersely.

**Legend:** 🔑 = genuinely *gates kickoff* (decide now). Everything else has a safe
default that can be revisited when we build that subsystem.

**Fast path:** accept all recommendations, or override by ID (e.g. "defaults except
RBAC‑2 and SCHED‑5"). Choices get recorded in the **Decision log** at the bottom.

---

## A. Tenancy (cross-cutting)

| ID | Decision | Options — **rec** | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔑 **TEN** | Isolation boundary | **Team = boundary, single implicit org** · vs multi-org now | Changes every isolation check + whether `org_id` exists in schema. Additive later is cheap; retrofitting multi-org isn't. |

## B. RBAC & Teams

| ID | Decision | Options — **rec** | Why / when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔑 **RBAC‑1** | Built-in roles | **owner / admin / member / viewer** (+guest later) | Seeds the roles table + every permission check. |
| **RBAC‑2** | Custom per-team roles in v1 | **Yes (cheap given the tables)** · vs built-ins only | Low impact; tables support either. |
| **RBAC‑3** | Cross-team sharing | **Within-team shares only in v1** · cross-team later | Scopes the `resource_grants` check. |
| 🔑 **RBAC‑4** | API token scope model | **issuer-perms ∩ explicit scopes** · vs fixed catalog | Defines token issuance + enforcement; hard to change later. |
| 🔑 **RBAC‑5** | Operator vs owner | **Distinct instance `operator`** · vs first-team-owner is operator | Shapes first-run bootstrap. |

## C. Persistence (gates the first build)

| ID | Decision | Options — **rec** | Why / when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔑 **DB‑1** | Migration mechanism | **Thin runner in `db-kit`: ordered Racket steps, per-dialect SQL, `schema_migrations` table** · vs raw SQL files · vs external lib | First slice creates tables; this keeps sqlite→Postgres a swap. |
| 🔑 **DB‑2** | Primary key strategy | **UUID (text)** · vs integer autoincrement | UUIDs survive federation/merge and avoid sqlite/pg sequence divergence; touches every table. |

## D. Quotas *(can ride defaults — built after RBAC)*

| ID | Decision | Options — **rec** |
|---|---|---|
| **QUOTA‑1** | v1 metered dimensions | **AI-first: tokens / requests / concurrency / rate** (defer storage, tasks) |
| **QUOTA‑2** | On exceed | **Budgets → hard reject; rate/concurrency → enqueue-and-delay** |
| **QUOTA‑3** | Windows | **Daily + monthly budgets, 60s rolling rate; UTC** (team override later) |
| **QUOTA‑4** | Team vs user | **`min(team, user)` caps, meter both** |
| **QUOTA‑5** | Token estimate | **Heuristic (chars/4) in v1**, tokenizer later |
| **QUOTA‑6** | Default limits | **Conservative default policy + small/med/large presets** |

## E. AI Workload Scheduler *(can ride defaults — built after quotas)*

| ID | Decision | Options — **rec** |
|---|---|---|
| **SCHED‑1** | Executor kinds v1 | **`local-model` only**, contract ready for `remote-model` |
| **SCHED‑2** | Job requirements | **`{model, est_tokens}`**, add compute `class` when CPU/HPC land |
| **SCHED‑3** | Remote transport | **Defer — interface only** (RI is local; no wire yet) |
| 🔑 **SCHED‑4** | Job durability | **Persisted `jobs` table from the start** · vs in-memory *(mild gate: schema)* |
| **SCHED‑5** | Fairness | **Priority + FIFO in v1** (policy seam ready for weighted-fair) · vs weighted-fair now |
| **SCHED‑6** | Governor scopes | **global + per-executor + per-team** v1; per-user later |
| **SCHED‑7** | Preemption | **Cancelable always; preemptible later** |

## F. Localization *(gates only if we run the localization slice early — recommended)*

| ID | Decision | Options — **rec** | Why / when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔑 **LOC‑1** | Catalog format | **ICU-MessageFormat in JSON** · Fluent · gettext PO | Defines the localizer + CLI + every catalog file. ICU = power + ubiquity; Fluent = strongest for complex l10n; PO = deepest tooling. |
| **LOC‑2** | v1 surfaces enforced | **UI + API + tool descriptions** first; emails/docs/plugins phased | Scopes the bare-literal scanner. |
| **LOC‑3** | Message ids | **Named namespaced keys** (`documents.editor.save`) · vs source-hash | Catalog maintainability. |
| **LOC‑4** | Release gate | **Advisory in v1** (only `en` 100% is hard-required) · vs coverage-blocking now | How strict CI is at launch. |
| **LOC‑5** | AI drafting | **Opt-in per locale**, via a new **`translation` model role** (fallback `utility`) · vs on-by-default | Auto-draft behavior + which model. |
| **LOC‑6** | Doc generation | **Separate follow-up design doc** · vs fold in now | Keeps localization doc focused. |

## What actually gates kickoff

Only the 🔑 rows: **TEN, RBAC‑1/4/5, DB‑1/2**, plus **LOC‑1/2/3** if we run the
localization slice early. The rest can ride defaults and be confirmed when we reach
that subsystem.

## Proposed first two build slices (once 🔑 are set)

1. **RBAC + persistence** — `db-kit` migration runner + `users / teams /
   memberships / roles / role_permissions / api_tokens / resource_grants /
   audit_log` tables + `AuthzService`, wired into the engine's `#:exec` permission
   check.
2. **`en` externalization + `telemachus-localize` CLI** — mostly independent;
   delivers the "flag unlocalized strings in CI" win early and proves the dogfood
   loop.
